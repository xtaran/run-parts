Run::Parts

Run::Parts is a Perl interface to Debian's run-parts tool.

run-parts runs all the executable files named within constraints
described below, found in the given directory.  Other files and
directories are silently ignored.

Additionally it can just print the names of the all matching files
(not limited to executables, but ignores blacklisted files like
e.g. backup files), but don't actually run them.

This is useful when functionality or configuration is split over
multiple files in one directory. A typical convention is that the
directory name ends in ".d". Common examples for such splittet
configuration directories:

  /etc/cron.d/
  /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/,
  /etc/aptitude-robot/pkglist.d/
  /etc/logrotate.d/
  /etc/rsyslog.d/

It may or may not work with RedHat's simplified shell-script based
reimplementation of Debian's run-parts.
