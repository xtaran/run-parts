Revision history for Run-Parts

0.10    UNRELEASED

        Replace "#!/usr/bin/perl" in test suite example scripts with
        "#!/usr/bin/env perl" to fix test suite failures on
        DragonFlyBSD which has no more compatibility link at
        /usr/bin/perl since recently.

        Fix issues reported by default perlcritic. (Patch by Alex
        Muntada, thanks!)

        Add repology package list badges to README.markdown.

        Switch bug tracker from rt.cpan.org to GitHub as rt.cpan.org
        is going away.

        Fix RT#127691 + GH#1 by checking, too, if /bin/run-parts is
        Debian's implementation.

        Fix link to Kwalitee status in README.

0.09    2015-08-18 02:23:22+0200

        Replace Modern::Perl with "use 5.010;" + strict and warnings.
        Drop perlcritic.rc.

        Add release test to verify 5.010 compatibility (for now).

        Polish README a little bit.

        Move release tests to xt/release and drop %ENV checking code.

        Require Test::Warnings >= 0.005 for "warnings".

        Replace individual xt/release/kwalitee.t with
        Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Kwalitee

0.08    2014-09-11 16:57:00+02:00

        Fix dist.ini to exclude emacs style backup files (except in
        the test data directory) as well as the cover_db.

        Hack around RT#66485 to be able to use done_testing() together
        with Test::NoWarnings. Also fixes number of skipped tests in
        t/basic-functionality.t on non-debianoid platforms.

        Fix Author vs Release test in t/manifest.t's skip message.

        Only run t/changes.t if $RELEASE_TESTING is set.

        Update t/win-*.t skip messages to in line with the others.

        Add a Test::Kwalitee based test.

0.07    2014-09-10 00:33:03+02:00

        Add test that the change log conforms to CPAN::Changes::Spec.

        Convert dates in change log to conform with
        CPAN::Changes::Spec.

        Require CPAN::Changes >= 0.23 for running the test suite.

        Switch to Dist::Zilla (with ExtUtils::MakeMaker) instead of
        Module::Build. Remove convenience Makefile.

        Fix Perl::Critic warning "Don't modify $_ in list functions"

        Consider Modern::Perl as ok for
        Perl::Critic::Policy::TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict

        Use Travis CI for smoke testing and Coveralls.io for coverage
        reporting.

        Fix passing backends as reference. Add test for that.

        Use "use_ok" instead of "use" in all tests.

        Drop unreachable else clause while listing the directory
        contents.

        Simplify condition in Run::Parts::Debian::run_parts_command.

        Further new tests added:
        + Verify behaviour upon unknown backend parameter.
        + Verify that chomped_lines and lines die if called like a method.
        + Alternative backend names (module=perl, run-parts=debian)

0.06    2013-07-22 20:47:16+02:00

        Bump Module::Build requirement to 0.4004 for test_requires.

0.04    2013-07-10 19:55:57+02:00

        New method concat.

        New helper module Run::Parts::Common.

        Run::Parts::Perl now works properly on DOS-ish platforms

        Some refactoring which pulls in new dependencies.

0.03    2013-07-05 21:01:59+02:00

        Run::Parts has been split up into frontend and backend
        modules.

        A pure Perl backend module has been added.

        Run::Parts now can either choose the appropriate backend
        itself or use a given backend.

0.02    2013-06-08 20:04:53+02:00

	Skip functionality tests if /bin/run-parts is not there or not
	executable.

	Add POD encoding to make Test::Pod happy

	State in Build.PL that the test suite needs Test::Differences and
	that Run::Parts itself needs Perl >= 5.10.

        Disable Makefile.PL compatibility.

0.01    2013-06-07 20:26:57+02:00
