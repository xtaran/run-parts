        Run::Parts::Perl now works properly on DOS-ish platforms

0.03    Fri Jul  5 21:01:59 CEST 2013

        Run::Parts has been split up into frontend and backend
        modules.

        A pure Perl backend module has been added.

        Run::Parts now can either choose the appropriate backend
        itself or use a given backend.

	Skip functionality tests if /bin/run-parts is not there or not
	executable.

	Add POD encoding to make Test::Pod happy

	State in Build.PL that the test suite needs Test::Differences and
	that Run::Parts itself needs Perl >= 5.10.

        Disable Makefile.PL compatibility.
